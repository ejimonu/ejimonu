#### Hi there,

I'm a Network Engineer with a couple of years under my belt working at both Enterprise and MSP level.

These days I spend a lot more time exploring the world of NetOps as well as Infrastructure as Code(Iac). I occasionally teach topics with practical demonstrations on my [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@chidiejimonu) channel.

Regardless, I do take the time to dabble into other technologies and topics that involve the use of code such as creative coding and web development.

During my free time I enjoy making sports illustrations. I hope that some day I can work on a project in this field as the passion that comes with it is something I find comfort in. (YNWA).

I document progress made on projects on my [website](https://ejimonu.github.io) and share some insights on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chidiebere-ejimonu/). However you are free to connect with me via any of the platforms listed [here](https://linktr.ee/chidiejimonu)
